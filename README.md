# Buh
## What is Buh?
Ever missed a command line tool to search and install/clone github repositories? Buh (hub backwards) aims to remedy this!

## Installation
Since it's current in production you can simply clone the project and checkout the dev branch. There you will find what you want under the bin/-folder.
